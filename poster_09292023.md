## Why & How Do We Continue Dr. Woodroofe's Work on Selection Bias

### Why?
- His previous works have beautiful ideas.

LLF  
use RWT to estimate  

Approach: add penalty _ and _  
Reason:
1. Spiking problem: if set strict boundary (1997)
2. Indentifiability issue:
3. can be absorbed

- Survey sampling is still important today! Although it now has a new terminology --- crowdsourcing.  
We did a trend study for crowdsourcing related articles in the field of epidemiology.  
1. Crawl XML files from PubMed Central with the BioC API in R.
2. Separate into two groups: Period 1 (before 2017) and Period 2 (after 2017).
3. Convert XML files to TEXT files. || Develop a keyword dictionary.
4. Develop a JAVA program to automatically count the number of appearances of the keywords from all the downloaded articles. 
5. Data analysis. ((The countings of the keywords preveal underlying trends.))
6. Conclusion: Crowdsourcing is popular today especially after the pandemic ...

### How?
- AUMPUT
As Dr. Sun's presentation shows, we are developing a new test for testing selection bias. But before that, we want to derive a baseline test under certain setting, so that our new test can be considered "good" if its power curves are comparable to the baseline test.  
An UMP test would be the best for us. However, in our case we have more than one parameter. Therefore, an UMPUT would be more realistic since for exponential family ditribution, conditional on one of the complete and sufficient statistic, the distribution would still be from the exponential family.
